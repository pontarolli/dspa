These approaches have changed software engineering practice in such a profound way that we argue that it is becoming a paradigm shift.

   abstract = {Pervasive networks formed spontaneously by wireless mobile devices capable of ad hoc communication make it possible to get services from these devices, and to compose them dynamically so as to provide people with new and more sophisticated application services. Discovering, invoking and composing services in such networks are challenging tasks, due to the numerous and unpredictable connectivity disruptions caused by mobility and the short radio range of wireless interfaces. By implementing the 'store, carry and forward' principle, opportunistic networking and computing can help tolerate connectivity disruptions and support communication in such intermittently-connected networks. In this paper, we present a system we have designed to discover, to select, to invoke and to compose REST services dynamically in opportunistic networks. This system implements both orchestration-based and choreography-based composition strategies. In this paper, we compare these two techniques in two different scenarios: one involving nomadic people roaming in an open area, and another one involving people attending a sport event.},

   abstract = {For standard industrial process control systems, blocks in a control loop are executed periodically. That is, the sampling data is fed to control blocks by sensors at a fixed rate. At the same rate, control blocks do some calculations on the inputs and send out commands to actuators. This paradigm works well with reliable wireline networks, such as Fieldbus and ProfiBus. However, it is a justified assumption that part of the wired networks will be replaced by wireless networks. With wireless networks, we shall expect intermittent communication losses. In this paper, we first identify the poor dynamic response of the standard PID algorithms in the case of lost communications. An enhanced PID algorithm is proposed to improve the dynamic response under these conditions. When there is no communication loss, the enhanced PID block acts exactly the same as a standard PID block. Lost data is compensated by the integral component in the enhanced PID block. When communications are reestablished, the derivative component in the enhanced PID block eliminates possible spikes in the output. We evaluate the enhanced PID algorithm under several wireless scenarios. The results demonstrate the advantages of the enhanced PID algorithm. Copyright 2006 by ISA.},

   abstract = {New cloud services are being developed to support a wide variety of real-life applications. In this paper, we introduce a new cloud service: industrial automation, which includes different functionalities from feedback control and telemetry to plant optimization and enterprise management. We focus our study on the feedback control layer as the most time-critical and demanding functionality. Today's large-scale industrial automation projects are expensive and time-consuming. Hence, we propose a new cloud-based automation architecture, and we analyze cost and time savings under the proposed architecture. We show that significant cost and time savings can be achieved, mainly due to the virtualization of controllers and the reduction of hardware cost and associated labor. However, the major difficulties in providing cloud-based industrial automation systems are timeliness and reliability. Offering automation functionalities from the cloud over the Internet puts the controlled processes at risk due to varying communication delays and potential failure of virtual machines and/or links. Thus, we design an adaptive delay compensator and a distributed fault tolerance algorithm to mitigate delays and failures, respectively. We theoretically analyze the performance of the proposed architecture when compared to the traditional systems and prove zero or negligible change in performance. To experimentally evaluate our approach, we implement our controllers on commercial clouds and use them to control: (i) a physical model of a solar power plant, where we show that the fault-Tolerance algorithm effectively makes the system unaware of faults, and (ii) industry-standard emulation with large injected delays and disturbances, where we show that the proposed cloud-based controllers perform indistinguishably from the best-known counterparts: local controllers.},

To achieve this set of requirements, new technologies and paradigms like Internet-of-Things (IoT), Big Data Analytics, Internet-of-Services (IoS), and service-oriented architecture (SOA) are being introduced into the industrial environments. These advances result in the confluence of two dissimilar, but complementary domains: the physical operational technologies (OT) and the cyber information technologies (IT) domains. Convergence of these two domains in a cross-layer fashion implies a new set of two major requirements of components and systems: 1) structural connectivity and 2) functional interoperability. However, the wide variety and heterogeneity of industrial systems-especially in the factory floor-entails integration complexity, which is in contrast with the mentioned requirements. In this paper, we focus on how legacy industrial systems can migrate in a cost-effective manner to the new paradigm of integrated IT-OT levels. We propose an interoperability layer requiring no changes on the legacy device that maps field device data into an ISA95-based information model.

Increasing facilities through the composition of services are considered as an essential module in this technology. Several types of services can be supplied in the IoT using the user's requirements to consider the user needs. However, the service composition in the IoT does not have any systematic and complete study about examining its significant techniques. So, this paper aims to investigate the available methods in this field using a systematic manner. To achieve a comprehensive view of the topic, all of the selected approaches are divided into four distinct categories, including framework, service oriented architecture and RESTful, heuristic, and model-based. The detailed classifications have been presented using various parameters based on the examination of the existing techniques. Also, the benefits and drawbacks of the state-of-The-Art service composition techniques and the important challenges of them are discussed. Finally, we have explained future work in the field of service composition in the IoT with detail in order to make an effective and efficient way for researchers in this area. We also have identified four important parameters to examine the selected service composition mechanisms in the IoT. Scalability is improved in 45.4%, execution time in 36.3%, cost in 27.2%, reliability in 22.7%, availability in 18.1%, and response time in 13.6% of the reviewed articles.},

Development of new technologies for provisioning innovative services and products can lead to new business opportunities for the industry. Monitoring and Control are seen as key for achieving visions in several CPS dominated areas such as industrial automation systems, automotive electronics, telecommunication equipments, smart-grid, building controls, digitally driven smart cities, home automation, greener transport, water and wastewater management, medical and health infrastructures, online public services and many others [10]. This chapter introduces cloud-based industrial CPS and describes the first results of making it a reality for the Next Generation SOA-based SCADA/DCS systems. The reader can learn about the research, development and innovation work carried out by a set of experts collaborating under the umbrella of the IMC-AESOP project, for specifying, developing, implementing and demonstrating the major features of Intelligent Monitoring and Control Systems and the advantages of implementing them in different industrial process control environments.},

Since then, many details of the described vision have become reality: Our mobile phones are powerful multimedia systems, our cars computer systems on wheels, and our homes are turning into smart living environments. All these advances must be turned into products for very cost-sensitive world markets in shorter cycles than ever before. Today, the resulting requirements for design, setup, and operation of our factories become crucial for success. In the past, we often increased the complexity in structures and control systems, resulting in inflexible monolithic production systems. But the future must become "lean"-not only in organization, but also in planning and technology!Wemust develop technologies which allow us to speed up planning and setup, to adapt to rapid product changes during operation, and to reduce the planning effort. To meet these challenges we should also make use of the smart technologies of our daily lives. But for industrial use, there are many open questions to be answered. The existing technologies may be acceptable for consumer use but not yet for industrial applications with high safety and security requirements. Therefore, the SmartFactoryKL initiative was founded by industrial and academic partners to create and operate a demonstration and research test bed for future factory technologies. Many projects develop, test, and evaluate new solutions. This presentation describes changes and challenges, and it summarizes the experience gained to date in the SmartFactoryKL. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This model creates a brand new opportunity for enterprises. In this paper, some of the essential features of cloud computing are briefly discussed with regard to the end-users, enterprises that use the cloud as a platform, and cloud providers themselves. Cloud computing is emerging as one of the major enablers for the manufacturing industry; it can transform the traditional manufacturing business model, help it to align product innovation with business strategy, and create intelligent factory networks that encourage effective collaboration. Two types of cloud computing adoptions in the manufacturing sector have been suggested, manufacturing with direct adoption of cloud computing technologies and cloud manufacturing - the manufacturing version of cloud computing. Cloud computing has been in some of key areas of manufacturing such as IT, pay-as-you-go business models, production scaling up and down per demand, and flexibility in deploying and customizing solutions. In cloud manufacturing, distributed resources are encapsulated into cloud services and managed in a centralized way. Clients can use cloud services according to their requirements. Cloud users can request services ranging from product design, manufacturing, testing, management, and all other stages of a product life cycle. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {In order to realize the full-scale sharing, free circulation and transaction, and on-demand-use of manufacturing resource and capabilities in modern enterprise systems (ES), Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) as a new service-oriented manufacturing paradigm has been proposed recently. Compared with cloud computing, the services that are managed in CMfg include not only computational and software resource and capability service, but also various manufacturing resources and capability service. These various dynamic services make ES more powerful and to be a higher-level extension of traditional services. Thus, as a key issue for the implementation of CMfg-based ES, service composition optimal-selection (SCOS) is becoming very important. SCOS is a typical NP-hard problem with the characteristics of dynamic and uncertainty. Solving large scale SCOS problem with numerous constraints in CMfg by using the traditional methods might be inefficient. To overcome this shortcoming, the formulation of SCOS in CMfg with multiple objectives and constraints is investigated first, and then a novel parallel intelligent algorithm, namely full connection based parallel adaptive chaos optimization with reflex migration (FC-PACO-RM) is developed. In the algorithm, roulette wheel selection and adaptive chaos optimization are introduced for search purpose, while full-connection parallelization in island model and new reflex migration way are also developed for efficient decision. To validate the performance of FC-PACO-RM, comparisons with 3 serial algorithms and 7 typical parallel methods are conducted in three typical cases. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for addressing complex SCOS in CMfg. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

The paper presents and evaluates an alternate approach of PID control accounting for non-periodic measurements with a Kalman filter observer that has been modified for use with a wireless measurement.

In the paper, it is pointed out that by letting sensor nodes transmit only when needed, it is possible to minimize the communication bandwidth utilization in these systems. We show how classical control strategies commonly based on periodic sampling, such as proportional-integral-derivative control and minimum variance control, can be cast in an event-based setting in which decentralized communication decisions are taken suitable for commonly used contention-based medium access control protocols. Event-triggered sampling for estimation is also reviewed. Simulated examples illustrate the results.},

Aim to guarantee the autonomy and interoperability of manufacturing system service, a systematical procedure is presented to define properly these services. These manufacturing services consider operations such as teleoperation and remote monitoring of manufacturing activities, users online request, and shared resources management. Based on the nature of this type of system it is considered discrete event system (DES), and techniques derived from Petri net (PN), including Production Flow Schema (PFS), are used in a PFS/PN modeling approach. This approach has been proven efficient for hierarchical description, analysis and control of DES. The system is approached in different levels of abstraction: a conceptual model which is developed through PFS technique and a functional model which is developed in PN. Finally, it is presented a particular implementation of the proposed procedure to define a manufacturing service, in which different and specific issues of distributed manufacturing activities are considered.},

Whereas, IoT is used to simplify the end devices and their connections to the rest of the system. In this paper we investigate the interplay of these two concepts and their use in the control applications in the automation industry. We develop a prototype in the industrial setup to explore the use of IoT devices that communicate with a cloud-based controller. Using the prototype, we perform a number of experiments to investigate the consequences of having a cloud server between the end device and the controller. Within this context we consider arbitrary jitter and delays, i.e., they can be smaller, equal or greater than the sampling periods. Moreover, we apply mitigation mechanisms to deal with the delays and jitter that are caused by the local and wide area networks (LAN and WAN).},

Concepts like Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) give us models but do not tell us how to facilitate actual implementations. This article discusses the transition from legacy automation technology as defined by ISA-95 to highly distributed Internet of Things (IoT)-and system of systems (SoS)-based automation systems that fully utilize Internet technologies, thus enabling the implementation of Industry 4.0 and RAMI 4.0 models. Distributed IoT automation systems have a number of general requirements concerning real-time performance, security, engineering cost, scalability, and interoperability. Meeting these requirements is necessary to enable possibilities for a realworld implementation of IoT automation. A key concept is local automation clouds. The discussion is based on a particular example of such an automation integration platform, the Arrowhead Framework.},

IoT services routinely processes security critical data that affects the privacy, safety, and security of users. However, suitable security mechanisms remain missing. Fundamental open challenges are the authentication of services, securing the metadata of services, and validating the correct functioning of security mechanisms on distributed entities under different authorities. In this paper we present a certificate- based methodology for authenticating services, securely adding information to their executables, and validating the correct functioning of distributed entities of our design. We add X.509 certificates with extended attributes to the service executables. By introducing different trust anchors, services and their metadata are protected through their entire life cycle from developers to the computing nodes running them. Our solution enables distributed nodes to verify the security properties locally. It enables reliably changing certificate properties across the distributed IoT nodes. It features autonomous certificate management. We evaluate the traffic caused by our autonomous certificate management process quantitatively. The presented solution is churn tolerant and applicable to diverse distributed systems.},

   abstract = {Microservice architecture allows different parts of an application to be developed, deployed and scaled independently, therefore becoming a trend for developing cloud applications. However, it comes with challenging security issues. First, the network complexity introduced by the large number of microservices greatly increases the difficulty in monitoring the security of the entire application. Second, microservices are often designed to completely trust each other, therefore compromise of a single microservice may bring down the entire application. The problems are only exacerbated by the cloud, since applications no longer have complete control over their networks. In this paper, we propose a design for security-as-a-service for microservices-based cloud applications. By adding a new API primitive FlowTap for the network hypervisor, we build a flexible monitoring and policy enforcement infrastructure for network traffic to secure cloud applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by deploying the Bro network monitor using FlowTap. Results show that our solution is flexible enough to support various kinds of monitoring scenarios and policies and it incurs minimal overhead (~6%) for real world usage. As a result, cloud applications can leverage our solution to deploy network security monitors to flexibly detect and block threats both external and internal to their network.},

Discovering, invoking and composing services in such networks are challenging tasks, due to the numerous and unpredictable connectivity disruptions caused by mobility and the short radio range of wireless interfaces. By implementing the 'store, carry and forward' principle, opportunistic networking and computing can help tolerate connectivity disruptions and support communication in such intermittently-connected networks. In this paper, we present a system we have designed to discover, to select, to invoke and to compose REST services dynamically in opportunistic networks. This system implements both orchestration-based and choreography-based composition strategies. In this paper, we compare these two techniques in two different scenarios: one involving nomadic people roaming in an open area, and another one involving people attending a sport event.},

This paper describes a configuration approach for late binding the intelligent devices into a group, where each device can be controlled and monitored individually or simultaneously. This can be used for creating higher level control or for simplifying the monitoring in situations where the devices within the group may change. The presented approach is also demonstrated by creating an adaptive human machine interface where the group of devices can be operated.

This particular system would also be able to communicate with waste management companies to take care of the overflowing disposal sites. The system involves the combination of a primary trash bin and an attached expanding auxiliary trash bin. The primary bin will have an ultrasonic sensor attached to its lid which allows it to detect the level of waste within the bin and once it reaches maximum capacity, signal for pick-up will be transmitted to the waste management company. Furthermore, to solve the immediate full capacity issue of the bin, the primary bin encompasses a compactor used to compress trash within the bin before overflowing. Additionally, the auxiliary bin would expand to contain additional waste while waiting for pick-up. The whole system is powered by solar panels attached to the lid of the primary bin, thus making it an environmentally friendly system.},

   abstract = {Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a technology that allows ordinary objects to be uniquely identified by "smart tags" which are also capable of storing small quantities of data. The term Internet of Things was originated from a vision strongly coupled with supply-chain concerns and RFID tagged objects. However the idea of such Internet of Things has evolved in a wider sense, referring now to a ubiquitous object society combining RFID, sensor networks and pervasive computing technologies. This scenario involves different requirements such as heterogeneity and dynamicity of objects, sensors, applications and protocols as well as the need for allowing the dynamic evolution of such applications. These issues seemed to be easily addressed if the principles of service-oriented computing (SOC), like loose coupling and heterogeneity, are used for constructing such architectures and applications. In this paper we underline what benefits SOC can offer to constructing a middleware for the Internet of Things. These concepts have been applied in a service-oriented middleware that tries to leverage the existing Internet of Things architectural concepts by using SOC principles in order to bring more flexibility and dynamicity. We describe the approaches used in that middleware and the lessons learned from that experience. This middleware was initially tested on an application for tracking and monitoring supply-chain objects, and later extended to target wider application domains that are also described in this paper. The project described here has become part of the OW2 AspireRFID open-source project. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Machine-to-machine communications are gaining tremendous interest from mobile network operators, equipment vendors, device manufacturers, as well as research and standardization bodies. Indeed, M2M is a promising technology for the development of Internet of Things communications platforms, with high potential to enable a wide range of applications in different domains. However, providing suitable answers to the issues stemming from IoT platform design requires middleware-level solutions to enable seamless interoperability between M2M-based applications and existing Internetbased services. To the best of our knowledge, available proposals in the field are still immature and tend to be proof of concept prototypes that address specific issues stemming from IoT domains. This article starts from a different perspective and aims at investigating the possibility of implementing M2M solutions on top of currently available, mature, production-level solutions. In this vein, we here present and discuss the design and implementation of an M2M application in the field of road traffic management that integrates, for the sake of efficiency, with a broad IMS-based service infrastructure. © 2011 IEEE.},

The platform is called NIMBLE and is currently being developed in a European research project. The presented approach utilizes microservice technology, and implements the core business functionality of the platform through a composition of decentralized, scalable services. The communication among services, and with platform users, manufacturers, suppliers, sensors and Web resources, is supported through simple protocols and lightweight mechanisms. Core business services of the implemented architecture are released as open source software, enabling multiple prospective platform-providers to establish B2B marketplaces for collaboration within their own industrial sector or region. To demonstrate microservices in practice, we present two scenarios, both related to manufacturing of wooden home buildings: one is IoT-based data sharing in a supply chain, and the other deals with product driven logistics planning. The further development of the platform will be driven by the requirements of at least four different use cases throughout Europe, and by incorporating advanced business models to support the growth of powerful network effects of the platform.},

The main concerns on these technologies are the delay, packet loss, processing effort and power consumption that IoT devices demand, in order to successfully transfer wireless data to the cloud. In exchange for the reduction of the power consumption, many of these technologies try to lower the data throughput, minimize security, or even reduce the distance range of device coverage. In this paper authors compare the performance of IoT application protocols, based on M2M delay and the extra payload that they enforce to the transmitted data. Experimentation tests reveal which protocol is best suited for different network and application scenarios accordingly.},

However, the selection of a standard and effective messaging protocol is a challenging and daunting task for any organisation because it depends on the nature of the IoT system and its messaging requirements. Copious messaging protocols have been developed and employed by various organisations based on their requirements in the last two decades. Though, none of them is able to support all messaging requirements of all types of IoT systems. Messaging protocol is an ongoing dilemma for the IoT industry; consequently, it is important to understand the pros and cons of the widely accepted and emerging messaging protocols for IoT systems to determine their best-fit scenarios. Therefore, this paper presents an evaluation of the four established messaging protocols MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and HTTP for IoT systems. Firstly, it presents the broad comparison among these messaging protocols to introduce their characteristics comparatively. Afterwards, it performs a further in-depth and relative analysis based on some interrelated criteria to gain insight into their strengths and limitations. Thus, based on this detailed evaluation, the user can decide their appropriate usage in various IoT systems according to their requirements and suitability.},

This proposes a worrisome problem to waste management companies as well as people in the community due to the rise in pollution caused by overflowing trash. Apart from pollution, diseases can also easily spread if overflowing waste are left uncollected. The goal of this paper would be to overcome all these difficulties in handling waste through designing a smart waste bin system that is not only cost-effective but also environmental friendly. This particular system would also be able to communicate with waste management companies to take care of the overflowing disposal sites. The system involves the combination of a primary trash bin and an attached expanding auxiliary trash bin. The primary bin will have an ultrasonic sensor attached to its lid which allows it to detect the level of waste within the bin and once it reaches maximum capacity, signal for pick-up will be transmitted to the waste management company. Furthermore, to solve the immediate full capacity issue of the bin, the primary bin encompasses a compactor used to compress trash within the bin before overflowing. Additionally, the auxiliary bin would expand to contain additional waste while waiting for pick-up. The whole system is powered by solar panels attached to the lid of the primary bin, thus making it an environmentally friendly system.},

Indeed, the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, promises to revolutionize production and manufacturing through the use of large numbers of networked embedded sensing devices, and the combination of emerging computing technologies, such as Fog/Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology. Unsurprisingly, such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. To get an overview of the field, we deem it important to systematically survey the academic literature so far, and distill from it various security requirements as well as their popularity. This paper consists of two contributions: our primary contribution is a systematic review of the literature over the period 2011-2019 on IIoT Security, focusing in particular on the security requirements of the IIoT. Our secondary contribution is a reflection on how the relatively new paradigm of Fog computing can be leveraged to address these requirements, and thus improve the security of the IIoT.},

Additionally, to implement access control it must be first defined somewhere, and the rest of the system needs to be aware of the rules and respect them. Since there are many resources in such a system, it becomes cumbersome to require users to authenticate themselves every time they attempt to access a new resource. "Single Sign On" (SSO) functionality, where a user's credentials are promulgated throughout the Global Information Grid (GIG) to reach all desired services, is a desirable capability but problematic. Additionally, in an SOA all of these security functions are implemented in XML, which brings its own set of problems. This paper will address the security challenges for a SOA. We will describe the problems stemming from the fact that XML is not inherently secure, resulting in special vulnerabilities in the security protocols. We will present strategies for mitigating these vulnerabilities to defend against replay attacks, encryption problems and policy considerations. © 2007 IEEE.},

   abstract = {State-of-the-art technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing (CC), big data analytics (BDA), and artificial intelligence (AI) have greatly stimulated the development of smart manufacturing. An important prerequisite for smart manufacturing is cyber–physical integration, which is increasingly being embraced by manufacturers. As the preferred means of such integration, cyber–physical systems (CPS) and digital twins (DTs) have gained extensive attention from researchers and practitioners in industry. With feedback loops in which physical processes affect cyber parts and vice versa, CPS and DTs can endow manufacturing systems with greater efficiency, resilience, and intelligence. CPS and DTs share the same essential concepts of an intensive cyber–physical connection, real-time interaction, organization integration, and in-depth collaboration. However, CPS and DTs are not identical from many perspectives, including their origin, development, engineering practices, cyber–physical mapping, and core elements. In order to highlight the differences and correlation between them, this paper reviews and analyzes CPS and DTs from multiple perspectives.},

Digital Twin (DT) technology is based on the integration of different “traditional” tools, such as simulation modeling and sensors, and is aimed at increasing process performance. In DTs, simulation modeling allows for the building of a digital copy of real processes, which is dynamically updated through data derived from smart objects based on sensor technologies. The use of DT within manufacturing activities is constantly increasing, as DTs are being applied in different areas, from the design phase to the operational ones. This study aims to analyze existing fields of applications of DTs for supporting safety management processes in order to evaluate the current state of the art. A bibliometric review was carried out through VOSviewer to evaluate studies and applications of DTs in the engineering and computer science areas and to identify research clusters and future trends. Next, a bibliometric and systematic review was carried out to deepen the relation between the DT approach and safety issues. The findings highlight that in recent years, DT applications have been tested and developed to support operators during normal and emergency conditions and to enhance their abilities to control safety levels.},

Most recently, the Manufacturing USA initiative was officially rolled out to further “leverage existing resources.. to nurture manufacturing innovation and accelerate commercialization” by fostering close collaboration between industry, academia, and government partners. In 2015, the Chinese government officially published a 10-year plan and roadmap toward manufacturing: Made in China 2025. In all these national initiatives, the core technology development and implementation is in the area of advanced manufacturing systems. A new manufacturing paradigm is emerging, which can be characterized by two unique features: integrated manufacturing and intelligent manufacturing. This trend is in line with the progress of industrial revolutions, in which higher efficiency in production systems is being continuously pursued. To this end, 10 major technologies can be identified for the new manufacturing paradigm. This paper describes the rationales and needs for integrated and intelligent manufacturing (i2M) systems. Related technologies from different fields are also described. In particular, key technological enablers, such as the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cloud computing are discussed.

To achieve the adoption of digital services, applications holding personal data must be secure while giving end-users as much control as possible. On the other hand, for software developers, the adoption of a security solution for microservices requires it to be easily adaptable to the application context and requirements while fully exploiting reusability of security components. This paper proposes a solution that targets key security challenges of microservice-based applications. Our approach relies on a coordination of security components, and offers a fine-grained access control in order to minimise the risks of token theft, session manipulation, and a malicious insider; it also renders the system resilient against confused deputy attacks. This solution is based on a combination of OAuth 2 and XACML open standards, and achieved through reusable security components integrated with microservices.},

However, current state of the art provides only limited insight into the particular security concerns of microservice system. With this paper, we seek to unravel some of the mysteries surrounding microservice security by: providing a taxonomy of microservices security; assessing the security implications of the microservice architecture; and surveying related contemporary solutions, among others Docker Swarm and Netflix security decisions. We offer two important insights. On one hand, microservice security is a multi-faceted problem that requires a layered security solution that is not available out of the box at the moment. On the other hand, if these security challenges are solved, microservice architectures can improve security; their inherent properties of loose coupling, isolation, diversity, and fail fast all contribute to the increased robustness of a system. To address the lack of security guidelines this paper describes the design and implementation of a simple security framework for microservices that can be leveraged by practitioners. Proof-of-concept evaluation results show that the performance overhead of the security mechanisms is around 11%.},

Building secure systems is greatly helped by deploying existing security mechanisms, but current literature does not guide developers about which mechanisms are actually used by developers of microservicesbased systems. This article describes the design and results of a systematic mapping study to identify the security mechanisms used in microservices-based systems described in the literature. The study yielded 321 articles, of which 26 are primary studies. Key findings are that (i) the studies mention 18 security mechanisms; (ii) the most mentioned security mechanisms are authentication, authorization and credentials; and (iii) almost 2/3 of security mechanisms focus on stopping or mitigating attacks, but none on recovering from them. Additionally, it emerges that experiments and case studies are the most used empirical strategies in microservices security research. The clear identification of most-used security solutions will facilitate the reuse of existing architectural knowledge to address security problems in microservices-based systems.},

Microservices emerged as an architectural design pattern aiming to address the scalability and ease the maintenance of online services. However, security breaches have increased threatening availability, integrity and confidentiality of microservice-based systems. A growing body of literature is found addressing security threats and security mechanisms to individual microservices and microservice architectures. The aim of this study is to provide a helpful guide to developers about already recognized threats on microservices and how they can be detected, mitigated or prevented; we also aim to identify potential research gaps on securing MSA. In this paper, we conduct a systematic mapping in order to categorize threats on MSA with their security proposals. Therefore, we extracted threats and details of proposed solutions reported in selected studies. Obtained results are used to design a lightweight ontology for security patterns of MSA. The ontology can be queried to identify source of threats, security mechanisms used to prevent each threat, applicability layer and validation techniques used for each mechanism. The systematic search yielded 1067 studies of which 46 are selected as primary studies. The results of the mapping revealed an unbalanced research focus in favor of external attacks; auditing and enforcing access control are the most investigated techniques compared with prevention and mitigation. Additionally, we found that most proposed solutions are soft-infrastructure applicable layer compared with other layers such as communication and deployment. We also found that performance analysis and case studies are the most used validation techniques of security proposals.},

To incorporate various design choices and customized policies in fog computing paradigm, Microservices is proposed as a new software architecture, which is easy to modify and quick to deploy fog applications because of its significant features, ie, fine granularity and loose coupling. Unfortunately, the Microservices architecture is vulnerable due to its wildly distributed interfaces that are easily attacked. However, the industry has not been fully aware of its security issues. In this paper, a survey of different security risks that pose a threat to the Microservices-based fog applications is presented. Because a fog application based on Microservices architecture consists of numerous services and communication among services is frequent, we focus on the security issues that arise in services communication of Microservices in four aspects: containers, data, permission, and network. Containers are often used as the deployment and operational environment for Microservices. Data is communicated among services and is vital for every enterprise. Permission is the guarantee of services security. Network security is the foundation for secure communication. Finally, we propose an ideal solution for security issues in services communication of Microservices-based fog applications.},

Therefore in this paper, we proposed a modular and scalable architecture based on lightweight virtualization. The modularity provided by the proposed architecture combined with lightweight virtualization orchestration supplied by Docker simplifies management and enables distributed deployments. Availability and fault-tolerance characteristics are ensured by distributing the application logic across different devices where a single microservice or even device failure can have no effect on system performance. The proposed architecture is instantiated and tested on a simple time-dependent use case.

The use of service-oriented architecture (SOA) is one step in the creation of basic and complex interactions between several sensors and actuators. However, the use of SOA-enabled technologies alone does not meet all requirements of how sensor and actuator systems could be integrated to create distributed monitoring and control applications. The centralized, traditional method of communication in wireless sensor networks via a gateway presents drawbacks that have to be addressed; device-to-cloud communication adds higher latency and higher power consumption and is less robust than the device-to-device (D2D) communication approach. Moreover, all these characteristics reduce the scalability of the network, thus limiting the use of IoT in the industry. In this article, the proposed method utilizes the arrowhead framework orchestration system to generate service composition within a (wireless) network formed by IoT devices. The aim is to achieve efficient D2D service invocation to reduce the drawbacks of today's widely used device-to-cloud approach. The method in this article performs efficient service composition for industrial IoT, including mapping SOA service composition in very small resource-constrained devices using the arrowhead orchestration. The results presented in this article at the service level can increase performance and robustness in fog computing on resource-constrained devices.},

Traditional methods of interoperability including protocol gateways and adapters are often used at the network layer. Recent work on application interoperability has emphasized the use of middleware or protocol proxy/gateway. However, middleware tends to move the interoperability problem rather than solving it, and there are scalability issues with increasing the number of proxies, reconfiguration effort, and required bandwidth and processing overheads. This paper proposes a secure, on-demand, and transparent protocol translator for the IIoT. Targeting the challenge of interoperability between Internet protocol-based communication protocols, this paper analyzes current solutions and develops a set of requirements to be met by IoT protocol interoperability. The proposed protocol translator is not a middleware, it is a service-oriented architecture-based participant, it is used on-demand when needed, it does not introduce design time dependencies, it operates transparently, it supports low-latency, and it is secured through the use of Arrowhead authorization and authentication.},

   abstract = {Nowadays two main reasons are determining the increased number of intelligent systems in manufacturing. The first one is market-driven: demand is more and more variable and mass customization is the new way to compete in manufacturing, requiring feasible reconfigurable manufacturing systems. The second one is technology-pushed: the increasing availability of highperformance, low-power electronic components and the emerging wireless technologies are boosting the creation of intelligent systems (with personal intelligent perception, reasoning, etc.). However research should still be done in intelligent systems' field. Since the complexity both of the topic and of the consequences on manufacturing domain, a framework for addressing the overall field should be defined. We propose the framework adopted in SOCRADES, a European research project exploiting Service Oriented Architecture paradigm both at the device and at the application level. Finally the impacts of SOCRADES architecture on manufacturing performance are described and motivated. © 2008 IEEE.},

A series of challenges have been systematically tackled the last years and demonstrated the feasibility of key parts. Among them, the IMC-AESOP has paved the way from web-service enabled systems to cloud-based industrial cyber-physical systems, and demonstrated with real industrial use cases various aspects with respect to next generation supervision control and data acquisition (SCADA) that may empower collaborative industrial systems. In this paper, a selected set of innovative results achieved within the IMC-AESOP project are summarized - migration strategies to the application of service based communication, system-wide introduction of Complex Event Processing capabilities, integration concepts between different generations of technologies and provision of cloud capabilities across different levels of production systems as well as experimentation in real industrial applications.},

   abstract = {The Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is quite established in enterprise environments as a pattern for software integration. However, traditional industrial architecture based on a vertical hierarchy is still used in old manufacturing organizations, making it difficult to reach the new requirements in industrial automation. There are works related with the use of SOA WS-* stack based frameworks, but this paradigm is not optimal due to the overhead in communication protocols. From this point of view, we propose a lightweight SOA architectural model based on the use of RESTful style for design and modeling of industrial processes. The aim is to explore a low developed research area to improve interoperability and flexibility in certain demanding manufacturing scenarios while similar performance of current industrial control standard is achieved. Theoretical advantages are presented and experimentally evaluated. In the evaluation, a prototype of the lightweight RESTful Framework and several scenarios of industrial devices are presented and response times are measured using two different RESTful protocols: HTTP and CoAP. From the results obtained it can be concluded that the performance of SOA with REST in industrial environments is suitable for current needs.},

The main goal of ANSI/ISA-88 is the control of batch processes, whereas the one of the ANSI/ISA-95 standard is the development of an automated interface between enterprise and control systems. In consequence, both standards should interoperate. However, there are gaps and overlappings between their corresponding terminologies. Moreover, there are additional problems, such as semantic inconsistencies within each of the standards, as well as the use of an informal graphical representations in one of the ANSI/ISA-88 models. This work presents an ontological approach that aims at formalizing the ISA-88 standard as a first step towards its integration with a formal representation of the ANSI/ISA-95 one. Additionally, methodological aspects of the ontology development process are presented.},

The technique can be applied when real-time synchronization of data acquisition systems is impossible or not sufficiently accurate. It allows for accurate synchronization based on the acquired dynamic response of the structure only, without requiring a common response or the use of a trigger signal. The synchronization is performed using the results obtained from system identification, and assumes linear dynamic behavior of the structure and proportional damping of the structural modes. A demonstration for a laboratory experiment on a cantilever steel beam shows that the proposed methodology can be used for accurate time synchronization, resulting in a significant improvement of the accuracy of the identified mode shapes.},

Most handheld smart devices, such as smart phones and tablets, employ accelerometers for motion tracking. The size constraints of such devices has provided the impetus to develop precise, affordable, compact, and power-efficient accelerometers. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers meet these strict requirements, thus explaining their wide adoption in the smart device market. The increasing cost-performance ratio, particularly regarding accuracy and bandwidth, of modern MEMS accelerometers enables their use in demanding measurement applications. This research introduces an open source battery-powered Internet of Things MEMS accelerometer called Memsio. Memsio is a versatile wireless sensor unit that can be deployed to measure a wide range of different motions. It is operated from a web browser, thus rendering it remotely accessible via smart phone, tablet, or computer. Furthermore, Memsio offers high-speed motion data acquisition capabilities and can store extended measurement periods lasting dozens of minutes; in addition, its wireless and portable nature eases integration in condition monitoring applications. The study presented reports on the construction and functionality of Memsio. Additionally, the functionality of Memsio is demonstrated in the measurement of translational movement of a linear actuator and the vibrations of large rotating machinery.},

We developed a low-cost (~US$56), open-source, customizable inline pressure sensor system with operational flexibility and simple data logging. Most pressure sensors are expensive, not customizable, specific to a single tubing size, provide only analog readings, have poor stability and precision, or are incomplete without a data logger. These issues limit the usefulness of such hardware. Our system addresses all of these concerns. The customizability of both the hardware and firmware (via options or code modification) allows for the device to be tailored easily to each application. Tubing diameter, adapter dimensions, sensor used, logging behavior, and integration with other systems can be configured with ease. Much of the practicality and configurability of the software and hardware arise from the use of our Loom code and ecosystem. We present experimental data for the flow of a viscous fluid between two parallel plates that shows that sudden changes in fluid properties are not always discernible in static images, but are detectable as pressure signals with our inline pressure sensor.},

In comparison to full-scale testing, scaled models are cost effective to construct and instrument and, when tested in a geotechnical centrifuge at increased centrifugal accelerations, are capable of replicating full-scale stress–strain soil behaviour. Centrifuge modellers require specialised hardware and instruments capable of functioning under high accelerations. Such hardware is costly, nearly always purpose built, and often rely on commercial, closed-source data acquisition systems, hardware and control systems. This paper demonstrates a novel and versatile, low cost, open source logger and control system that works in parallel alongside existing centrifuge hardware. This solution, termed Fly-by-Pi, was developed using the Raspberry Pi microcomputer. The system provides closed-loop control of linear actuators with the ability to operate in either cyclic, monotonic, or static load- or displacement-control. The control mechanism can be reprogrammed according to experimental requirements, even during flight in the centrifuge. Three independent experiments are described which included the Fly-by-Pi controller as a key component in their operation. Based on the experience gained during these experiments, the authors encourage wide-spread adoption of open-sourced hardware solutions in extreme testing environments.},

   abstract = {The Griggs apparatus is a triaxial piston-cylinder instrument used in deformation experiments of geological material at temperatures up to 1200 °C and confining pressures up to 3 GPa. Currently, most Griggs apparatuses can carry out deformation experiments only at constant displacement rate. As a result, few experimental studies have explored other geologically-relevant deformation scenarios. We present supplemental instrumentation and software that enables Griggs apparatus users to carry out deformation experiments at controlled differential stress conditions. The add-on instrument includes a feedback loop mechanism that regulates the imposed differential stress on the sample and a data acquisition system that allows for real-time display of mechanical data in units of stress and displacement. We demonstrate the application of this instrument through two deformation experiments at constant differential stress on (1) an aluminum cylinder at room temperature and (2) a quartz aggregate at 850 °C, both at ~1 GPa confining pressure. These experiments show that the instrument can reliably control the imposed differential stress on the sample throughout the deformation. Applications of the instrument can be extended beyond constant differential stress to more sophisticated stress paths (e.g., stress pulse, stress ramp) or to maintain true strain rates by accounting for anticipated geometrical changes in the sample during deformation.},

   abstract = {Geotechnical centrifuges are valuable instruments for physical modelling of complex geotechnical problems in a controlled laboratory setting. In comparison to full-scale testing, scaled models are cost effective to construct and instrument and, when tested in a geotechnical centrifuge at increased centrifugal accelerations, are capable of replicating full-scale stress–strain soil behaviour. Centrifuge modellers require specialised hardware and instruments capable of functioning under high accelerations. Such hardware is costly, nearly always purpose built, and often rely on commercial, closed-source data acquisition systems, hardware and control systems. This paper demonstrates a novel and versatile, low cost, open source logger and control system that works in parallel alongside existing centrifuge hardware. This solution, termed Fly-by-Pi, was developed using the Raspberry Pi microcomputer. The system provides closed-loop control of linear actuators with the ability to operate in either cyclic, monotonic, or static load- or displacement-control. The control mechanism can be reprogrammed according to experimental requirements, even during flight in the centrifuge. Three independent experiments are described which included the Fly-by-Pi controller as a key component in their operation. Based on the experience gained during these experiments, the authors encourage wide-spread adoption of open-sourced hardware solutions in extreme testing environments.},

   abstract = {Controversy exists about the maximum amount of protein that can be utilized for lean tissue-building purposes in a single meal for those involved in regimented resistance training. It has been proposed that muscle protein synthesis is maximized in young adults with an intake of ~20-25g of a high-quality protein; anything above this amount is believed to be oxidized for energy or transaminated to form urea and other organic acids. However, these findings are specific to the provision of fast-digesting proteins without the addition of other macronutrients. Consumption of slower-acting protein sources, particularly when consumed in combination with other macronutrients, would delay absorption and thus conceivably enhance the utilization of the constituent amino acids. The purpose of this paper was twofold: 1) to objectively review the literature in an effort to determine an upper anabolic threshold for per-meal protein intake; 2) draw relevant conclusions based on the current data so as to elucidate guidelines for per-meal daily protein distribution to optimize lean tissue accretion. Both acute and long-term studies on the topic were evaluated and their findings placed into context with respect to per-meal utilization of protein and the associated implications to distribution of protein feedings across the course of a day. The preponderance of data indicate that while consumption of higher protein doses (>20g) results in greater AA oxidation, this is not the fate for all the additional ingested AAs as some are utilized for tissue-building purposes. Based on the current evidence, we conclude that to maximize anabolism one should consume protein at a target intake of 0.4g/kg/meal across a minimum of four meals in order to reach a minimum of 1.6g/kg/day. Using the upper daily intake of 2.2g/kg/day reported in the literature spread out over the same four meals would necessitate a maximum of 0.55g/kg/meal.},

It is based on the Service Oriented Architecture philosophy. The building elements of the framework are systems that provide and consume services, and cooperate as systems of systems. Some commonly used systems, such as orchestration, authorization or service registry are considered as core. These can be used by any system of systems that follow the guidelines of the Arrowhead Framework. Within the framework, systems – using different information exchange technologies during collaboration – are helped through various approaches. These include the so-called Interoperability Layer, as well as systems and services for translation. Furthermore, one of the main problems of developing such highly interoperable systems is the lack of understanding between various development groups. Adequate development and service documentation methodologies can help to overcome this issue. The design, development and verification methodology for each service, system and system of systems within the Arrowhead Framework supports that these can be implemented, verified, deployed, and run in an interoperable way.

   abstract = {Industry 4.0 has led to a dramatic shift in manufacturing processes, which must be accomplished by interacting end-to-end industrial systems. While Industry 4.0 is still a big challenge for many manufacturing companies, reference architectures have been increasingly adopted in different domains to guide engineers on how their systems should interoperate and be structured. Companies have made different experiences with reference architectures for Industry 4.0. However, depending on the use cases addressed, a reference architecture may be more or less suited to support the transformation of a particular company. Besides, a complete understanding of existing representative architectures does not exist. The main goal of this work is to review existing reference architectures for Industry 4.0 and analyze them concerning their suitability for supporting Industry 4.0 processes and solutions. For this, we systematically researched these architectures and thoroughly analyzed and characterized them. We also address their use and technologies/tools that could support their implementation. As a result, we found that existing architectures still have a long way to go; hence, we present the most urgent steps for the near future. We conclude that the Industry 4.0 community is right in investing in reference architectures considering the future of Industry 4.0.},

As the digitalization trend goes on with an increasing pace and with the involvement of a diverse set of actors, proper management of this digital layer as well as the services deployed over it becomes ever more crucial. This paper presents our methodology of transforming the complex smart city concept and its digital layer into a structured model for creating a dynamic and adaptive service ecosystem in the digital cities of the future. An overview of the smart city concept and the three-tier architecture that emerges through the digitalization of cities is presented first, together with the main challenges in attaining coherent smart city service environments that can avoid fragmentation, ensure scalability, and allow reuse. The three major enablers that are identified in this direction are 1) a semantic functional description of city objects, representing physical devices or abstract services; 2) a distributed service directory that embodies available city services for service lookup and discovery; and 3) planning tools for selecting and chaining basic services to compose new complex services. For each of these, a high-level overview of the available tools and results from the research literature are provided as well as the relevant standards. This overview is complemented with our own approach and design choices in project ISCO (Internet of smart city objects). Through the implementation of two distinct use cases, this paper illustrates how ISCO components can jointly enrich service creation and consumption of various stakeholders in smart cities.},

Achieving this vision involves the abstraction of IoT objects resources as services and the composition of these services. A major obstacle to the use of services is the discovery and selection of these services. Due to the excessive number of connected objects searching and discovering specific services offered by these objects is becoming a challenging task. The use of traditional solution of service discovery is non-practical for IoT due to its scale and complexity. Enabling an easy and seamless discovery of these IoT services is crucial for the success of IoT. Resource discovery in IoT has captured much attention in both academia and industry. Therefore, many architectures and frameworks have been proposed to provide solutions for its issues. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art study of service discovery methods in IoT systems, classifying them according to their search approaches and providing a comparison of the selected works. Equally, we identify and discuss key challenges and future research directions that will support the success of IoT.},

Service discovery and allocation in smart manufacturing aim to provide on-demand manufacturing capabilities for meeting customized production requirements. They are tightly coupled in practice, whereas they are usually considered as two independent processes and investigated separately in most research. Meanwhile, the collaboration relationship and decision autonomy of service providers are rarely taken into account to perform sustainable and flexible production. To deal with these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework to holistically describe the active discovery and optimal allocation of smart manufacturing services. A mechanism is designed to consider the collaborative relationship of manufacturing resources and promote collaborative production. The distributed optimization model based on analytical target cascading method is introduced to maintain the decision autonomy of service providers and achieve the optimal allocation of smart manufacturing services. A case study is further provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

   abstract = {There is a large variety of Internet of things (IoT) devices and their peripherals available in consumer markets, and IoT deploy-ers should work on customizing device drivers that are compatible with their peripherals. Implementing compatible device drivers, however, often requires a burden of work. This paper proposes a generic platform that enables plug-and-play (PnP) integration for sensors and actuators to allow the addition and removal of IoT device peripherals without re-customizing all the device drivers. To this end, we employ IoT ontologies and semantics to represent IoT device characteristics and to infer IoT device behaviors. IoT device behavior is then passed to the generic device driver to cover device-specific operation. Since the generic device driver selectively operates most of the available function calls required in IoT devices, most of the programming work that is normally required for device customization is removed, and management overhead for software installation and maintenance can be minimized. To this end, we employ IoT ontologies and semantics as well as generic programming techniques in the generic platform in order to configure and control IoT devices. In the proposed platform, IoT device characteristics, including I/O functions and configuration rules, are defined using custom-built IoT ontologies, and operational behaviors are inferred through SPARQL queries. The generic platform then passes function-call name and configuration rules corresponding to the newly added peripheral device's specification. The experimental results show that our generic platform covers most of the popular sensors available in the market. Our solution therefore enables a true PnP experience of sensors and actuator peripherals in IoT devices.},

   abstract = {Smart and connected devices offer enormous potential to enable context-aware, localized, and multi-device orchestrations that could substantially increase the reach and utility of computing. The growth of these applications has been hampered, however, as devices, their data, and their control have been largely sequestered to their own vendor-specific APIs, clouds, and applications-a largely stove-piped state of affairs. Where barriers between devices have been pierced, the connections often occur between vendor clouds, affecting the latency, privacy, and reliability of the original application, while simultaneously increasing complexity. Locally executing applications have not materialized as devices with incompatible communication protocols, inconsistent APIs, and incongruent data models rarely communicate. We claim that what is needed to unlock the application potential is an architecture tailored to facilitating applications composed of networked devices. Our proposed architecture addresses this by providing a port-based abstraction for devices using a small wrapper layer. This device abstraction provides a consistent view of devices, and embeddable runtimes provide existing applications straightforward access to devices. The architecture also supports device discovery, shared interfaces between devices, and an application specification interface that promotes creating device-agnostic applications capable of operating even when devices change. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture with two application case studies that highlight the abstraction layers between applications and devices and employ the embeddability of our system to add new functionality to existing systems.},

The characteristics of business processes in these levels differ enough to prevent the adoption of a conventional modelling or implementation solution. The conceptualisation of an adequate and adaptable workflow management model that over-arches the heterogeneous business process levels is challenging. However, one of the encouragements of Industry 4.0 is to provide easy-to-use models and solutions that enable the effective implementation of production goals.The current paper addresses this challenge and - as a proof-of-concept - it demonstrates how the goals mentioned above can be achieved by combining the different manufacturing process models. To accomplish this, a workflow control engine needs to be designed and standardised respectively. Arrowhead is an IIoT (Industrial IoT) framework that dynamically and flexibly supports automated manufacturing processes following Industry 4.0 expectations. This paper describes how its workflow management system, i.e., the Workflow Choreographer implements automated production. Furthermore, it details what the functions of this system are and how it applies and combines BPMN and CPN in practice to provide a solution for the given challenge.To verify its feasibility, the paper showcases a demo application of the concept as well.},

Although it extends the computation power and information sharing capabilities of the network robots, the development and operations (DevOps) of the CR system are currently limited for enterprise-scale projects due to the heavy framework. In fact, current developed CR systems are typical distributed monomer architectures followed by a “top-down” design. As the scale of the applications gets larger, the operation and maintenance of CR systems will become a very difficult task. In this paper, a new architecture for a microservice-based cloud robotics system in intelligent space is proposed to solve the present dilemma. To enable this, we design a service management architecture based on a microservice to provide a highly efficient and flexible development/deployment mechanism. The container technology based on the docker engine is then used to functionally decompose the application into a set of collaborating services to ensure the software design methods, based on microservice, easy for implementation. Finally, a real experiment on SLAM (Simulation localization and mapping) in an intelligent space is implemented to verify the proposed architecture. Compared with traditional monomer architectures, the results show that the proposed framework is more productive, flexible and cost effective.},

Interoperability among the 'things' appears to be one of the biggest conceptual and technological challenges in developing the IIoT framework. Typically, collaboration at the field device level is very limited. Instead, the decision-making process is usually propagated to higher levels with substantial computational resources. This centralized architecture has been widely deployed based on global cloud infrastructure. However, sending data over the cloud for analysis may bring about privacy and security threats. Besides, network latency could be another factor that reduces adaptability. In this article, we propose a decentralized approach that applies the concepts of local automation cloud. By using semantic technologies to achieve autonomicity, the approach enables real-time monitoring of the control systems within one local cloud and automates orchestration and configuration locally through adaptation based on semantic policies. The approach is deployed and tested on a chemical production use case in which business-level policies have been used for dynamical planning for suppliers and automatic detection of malfunctioning sensors with subsequent adaptation to continuing supply planning and production as smooth as possible.},

   abstract = {Everyday a huge amount of solid waste generates. It generates from various sources such as from industries, markets, house complexes, etc. This waste also varies in state and shape. As the human involvement is rising in nature, we have seen a rapid growth in solid waste in the world. Due to rise in solid waste, various problems have arisen in society. To reduce those problems and build a well-defined solid waste management, we have developed a "GEO-LOCATION BASED ADVANCE WASTE COLLECTION" system. This system focuses on optimization of entire solid waste management process. For a specific region or city, garbage bins are set to different locations in that city or respective region. An ultra-sonic sensor is attached to every garbage bin. As soon as the garbage gets overflow from bin, this sensor sends a signal to a Wi-Fi module which then send data to web application. Current status of garbage bin is monitored by management personnel. Selection of proper vehicle to collect waste from a site and to dump it on a dumping site is one of the task of the management personnel. The respective vehicle would lift the garbage and dump it on a dumping site through an optimized way. Management personnel can analyze vehicle trip reports for further evaluation. An application has developed for citizens to initiate a complaint regarding waste. They can further track the status of their complaints. This system is economically beneficial to the authorities because of its high efficiency and optimization.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) has kindled the possibility of a lot of smart industrial systems. With the evolution of these IoT systems in the form of size and complexity, there is a growing need for a high level of interoperability. Autonomic Computing, with the vision of equipping software systems with self-management capabilities, emerges as a potential catalyst to support interoperability. In this paper, we present an approach which exploits Autonomic Computing to facilitate the development of interoperable IoT systems at semantic level. Our approach extends state-of-the-art IoT ontologies as well as Semantic Web Technologies to fit the MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute-Knowledge) paradigm in Autonomic Computing. By using a Smart Home Use Case, the approach is also evaluated under different performance criteria.},

Based on this model, some key enabling technologies, such as configuration of sensors, active sensing of real-time manufacturing information, services encapsulation, registration and publishing method are designed. By implementing the proposed services encapsulation and virtualization access model to manufacturing machine, the capability of the machine could be actively perceived, the production process is transparent and can be timely visited, and the virtualized machine could be accessed to CMfg platform through a loose coupling, ‘plug and play’ manner. The proposed model and methods will provide the real-time, accurate, value-added and useful manufacturing information for optimal configuration and scheduling of large-scale manufacturing resources in a CMfg environment.},

But with these advantages many new problems have been introduced and some existing problems have become so much critical. One of the existing problems that have become critical in cloud environment is access control. Access control is a procedure that allows a user to access data or file from system. There are several access policies which have to be followed by the users for accessing any kind of data from a server. In cloud environment there are many access control models. In this paper a new access control model namely Profile Based Access Control Model (PrBAC) has been proposed. There are several problems for accessing data like high access time, high searching cost and problem of data redundancy. Another problem of access control models is that the Data Owner (DO) must be always online when user wants to access data from cloud server. By PrBAC all these problems are minimized.},

   abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse-definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects-is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms. © 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This paper aims to support the creation of high performance 'Plug-and-Produce' systems by proposing a new semantic model that targets the use of AutomationML (AML). In this direction, the focus is narrowed to the self-description of equipment modules that highlights the use of 'Skill' concept. An insight description on how the concept of 'Skill Recipe' can be used to execute the equipment 'Skills' to fulfil the product's assembly requirements is also provided. This is viewed as a critical concept to achieve high performance in 'Plug-and-Produce'. To translate the base semantic definitions, we have developed new libraries that are fully compliant with the AML standard. The main purpose of using AML in this context is to bridge production and other engineering domains. An overview of the literature that covers the past and current trends in data exchange and standards is presented, while pointing out the existing challenges and limitations. The vision of this paper is to support the standardization effort of integrating information for design, build, ramp-up and operation of production systems. Hence, this approach elucidates the use of existing AML concepts to model and instantiate Product, Process and Resource (PPR), and the underlying definitions such as: 'Skills', 'Skill Recipes' and 'Skill Requirements'. Finally, this paper illustrates the implementation of this approach in AML with a help of an industrial case study demonstrated within the openMOS project.},

   abstract = {In cities dengue is endemic, various protocols exist for monitoring the disease activity as well as its risk factors, such as vector density, climate favorable for transmission and case counts. However, the complexity and cost of the data collection, together with the delays caused by the flow of data from data collections systems, through central health authorities and back to the health agents in charge of controlling the disease, makes timely responses to dengue outbreaks very hard to achieve. In this presentation we describe a system put in place through a joint initiative of the Brazilian National Health Ministry, city level health authorities, and multiple research institutions, bringing together epidemiologists, statisticians, entomologists, computer scientists among other specialties, to tackle the problem of bringing up-to-date epidemiological information to health agents, local decision-makers and the population as a whole. This system is operating in 788 cities in Brazil since 2015 (http://info.dengue.mat.br). One of the main design goals of the system was to include all data streams deemed relevant which were available on a regular time-frame. These are data streams selected based not only on their epidemiological relevance, but also on their continuous availability: mention about dengue on Twitter, filtered according to content and aggregated as a city level time series. Climate data (temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure measure); epidemiological data (these are the official case data, clinically confirmed cases reported by medical professionals through official channels). A pipeline was developed to clean, filter, and integrate the datasets. Statistical techniques were developed to: –correct for reporting delay using a efficient bayesian framework; –estimate the effective reproductive number of dengue taking into account the variation in temperature; –and to detect sustained transmission. The pipeline delivers a classification of alert every week: green (poor conditions for transmission), yellow (favorable transmission conditions), orange (sustained transmission), red (high incidence). To assess the quality of the system, a confusion matrix was constructed to compare the system classification with an expert classification of risk. At last, we discuss how the developed pipeline can be extended to other climate-sensitive diseases, exemplifying with zika and chikungunya.},

   abstract = {Background: Globally, dengue, Zika virus, and chikungunya are important viral mosquito-borne diseases that infect millions of people annually. Their geographic range includes not only tropical areas but also sub-tropical and temperate zones such as Japan and Italy. The relative severity of these arboviral disease outbreaks can vary depending on the setting. In this study we explore variation in the epidemiologic potential of outbreaks amongst these climatic zones and arboviruses in order to elucidate potential reasons behind such differences. Methodology: We reviewed the peer-reviewed literature (PubMed) to obtain basic reproduction number (R0) estimates for dengue, Zika virus, and chikungunya from tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions. We also computed R0 estimates for temperate and sub-tropical climate zones, based on the outbreak curves in the initial outbreak phase. Lastly we compared these estimates across climate zones, defined by latitude. Results: Of 2115 studies, we reviewed the full text of 128 studies and included 65 studies in our analysis. Our results suggest that the R0 of an arboviral outbreak depends on climate zone, with lower R0 estimates, on average, in temperate zones (R0 = 2.03) compared to tropical (R0 = 3.44) and sub-tropical zones (R0 = 10.29). The variation in R0 was considerable, ranging from 0.16 to 65. The largest R0 was for dengue (65) and was estimated by the Ross-Macdonald model in the tropical zone, whereas the smallest R0 (0.16) was for Zika virus and was estimated statistically from an outbreak curve in the sub-tropical zone. Conclusions: The results indicate climate zone to be an important determinant of the basic reproduction number, R0, for dengue, Zika virus, and chikungunya. The role of other factors as determinants of R0, such as methods, environmental and social conditions, and disease control, should be further investigated. The results suggest that R0 may increase in temperate regions in response to global warming, and highlight the increasing need for strengthening preparedness and control activities.},

   abstract = {Brazil has a well-established immunization program in which vaccines are provided through the Public Health System free of charge to the whole population, obtaining high coverage and reducing the incidence of important infectious diseases in children and adults. However, the environmental changes and high mobility rates of the population occurring in the last decades have triggered the sequential introduction of a series of vector-borne emerging infectious diseases, such as Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya, that have imposed a considerable burden on the population, with yet unmet solutions. The first to be introduced in Brazil was the Dengue virus, reaching epidemic levels in 2010, with over 1 million cases annually, maintaining high infection rates until 2016. Brazil has invested in vaccine development. The Zika virus infection, initially assumed to have appeared during the World Cup in 2014, was later shown to have arrived earlier in 2013. Its emergence mobilized the Brazilian scientific community to define priorities and strategies, that rapidly investigated mechanisms of pathogenesis, differential diagnostics, and determined that Zika virus infection per se causes relatively mild symptoms, however, in pregnant women can cause microcephaly in the newborns. The diagnostics of Zika infection is confusing given its similar symptoms and cross-reactivity with Dengue, which also hindered the appraisal of the extent of the epidemics, which peaked in 2015 and finished in 2016. Another complicating factor was the overlap with Chikungunya virus infection, which arrived in Brazil in 2014, being prevalent in the same regions, with similar symptoms to both Dengue and Zika. Although Dengue infection can be fatal and Zika infection in pregnant woman can lead to newborns with microcephaly or an array of neurodegenerative manifestations, the Chikungunya infection is a debilitating disease leaving chronic sequelae, which unfortunately has received less attention. Precise differential diagnostics of Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya will be necessary to evaluate the actual extent of each of these diseases during this overlapping period. Here we review the impact of these emerging infections on public health and how the scientific community was mobilized to deal with them in Brazil.},

The geographical range of dengue is expected to further expand due to ongoing global phenomena including climate change and urbanization. We applied statistical mapping techniques to the most extensive database of case locations to date to predict global environmental suitability for the virus as of 2015. We then made use of climate, population and socioeconomic projections for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080 to project future changes in virus suitability and human population at risk. This study is the first to consider the spread of Aedes mosquito vectors to project dengue suitability. Our projections provide a key missing piece of evidence for the changing global threat of vector-borne disease and will help decision-makers worldwide to better prepare for and respond to future changes in dengue risk. Statistical mapping techniques provide insights into the current geographical spread of the mosquito-borne dengue virus infection and predict changes in the areas that will be environmentally suitable to the virus for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080.},

   abstract = {O objetivo dos estudos reportados nesta dissertação é avaliar o uso da Espectroscopia de infravermelho em conjunto com técnicas quimiométricas de análise multivariada, como uma nova ferramenta para detecção e tipagem de arbovírus presentes em amostras clínicas. Nesta dissertação constam 4 artigos: 1 artigo de revisão e 3 artigos de pesquisa. O artigo de revisão faz um levantamento das principais técnicas espectroscópicas e técnicas de análise multivariada utilizadas em estudos no campo da virologia nos últimos 10 anos, bem como as vantagens destas, frente às técnicas padrão. No primeiro artigo de pesquisa, modelos multivariados baseados em análise discriminante foram construídos com o objetivo de discriminar quantitativamente o sorotipo DENV-3 presente em quatro diferentes concentrações em amostras de soro e sangue. No segundo estudo, técnicas de seleção de variáveis foram aplicadas com o objetivo de discriminar amostras de soro e sangue infectadas em laboratório, e ainda, predizer qual o sorotipo é responsável pela infecção. No terceiro estudo, foi avaliada a capacidade da técnica em discriminar entre 4 grupos de amostras: dengue (amostras de sangue de pacientes diagnosticados com dengue), Chikungunya (amostras de sangue de pacientes diagnosticados com Chikungunya), Zika (amostras de sangue de pacientes diagnosticados com Zika) e saudáveis (amostras de sangue de voluntários saudáveis). Os algoritmos de análise multivariada utilizados foram Análise de Componentes Principais-Análise Discriminante Linear (PCA-LDA), Algoritmo de Projeções Sucessivas-Análise Discriminante Linear (SPA-LDA) e Algoritmo Genético-Análise Discriminante Linear (GA-LDA). O desempenho da técnica foi avaliado através de cálculos de sensibilidade, especificidade, valores preditivos positivos e negativos, índice de Youden e razão de verossimilhança positiva e negativa. Os resultados foram animadores, e mostraram que a espectroscopia utilizada em conjunto com técnicas de análise multivariada tem o potencial de detectar e identificar as variações provocadas pela presença do vírus da dengue em amostras biológicas, e fornecer resultados rápidos em comparação às técnicas de diagnóstico utilizadas em rotinas clínicas.},

Industrial automation traditionally relies on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), and remote I/O is an important element of this infrastructure. The remote I/O is responsible for the data acquisition of sensors and actuators of industrial processes. The distributed I/O represents an evolution of the remote I/O to include processing and support network communication. With the adoption of recent technologies within the industry 4.0, automation solutions are facing servitization and being develop as a service. This paper describes the development of an open-source and low-cost distributed I/O as a service for industrial automation. The solution is based on a single board computer with I/O expansion modules, a microservice framework and a customized software to enable the I/O data acquisition to function in a networked, standardized, and scalable manner. Some application examples of the distributed I/O service are presented such as the I/O redundancy and historian, process control, and IIoT monitoring.},

Even though there are many advantages of using MOA in industrial applications, such as the vertical interoperability, there is also an important concern about how to protect these services at different levels and to provide a secure service communication. The security aspect in MOA requires specific mechanisms due to the service interactions in these architectures. This paper investigates proper security mechanisms for industrial SOA and MOA. Several security mechanisms, such as HTTPS for message encryption and authentication, authentication in the transporter service and a guard service that controls the access among services, are implemented and tested in a MOA. A discussion about the benefits of the security mechanisms is presented as well as an analysis of the impact on the MOA communication performance due to these mechanisms' inclusion. Experimental results obtained in a MOA-based process control plant show that there is tradeoff between adding security mechanisms or obtaining better communication performance for the MOA in terms of service composition cycle time (execution time of required sequence of services).},

   abstract = {A novel architecture for the field of industrial automation is described, the goals of which are: 1) computation of optimal production plans; 2) automated usage of the optimized plans; 3) flexibility and reusability at development and maintenance; and 4) seamless transition from current practice to the approach introduced herein. The architecture consists of three main components: 1) a set of OPC unified architecture (UA) servers, which are used to model the information from the device level; 2) a set of services organized into two layers (basic and complex services), which act as a link between the first and the third layer; and 3) a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) layer for the computation of production plans. Extensive performance tests motivate the choice of the service development framework, and prove the effectiveness of the special adapter software solution for the integration of current devices and the ability of the UA server to manage a high number of UA connections. As a proof-of-concept, the architecture has been tested for a real manufacturing problem composed of four flexible manufacturing systems. The results show that the architecture is able to efficiently control and monitor a real manufacturing process according to an optimized schedule with over 99% of the time spent on the manufacturing. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

Even though the design principles around microservices have been identified, it is difficult to have a clear view of existing research solutions for architecting microservices. In this paper we apply the systematic mapping study methodology to identify, classify, and evaluate the current state of the art on architecting microservices from the following three perspectives: publication trends, focus of research, and potential for industrial adoption. More specifically, we systematically define a classification framework for categorizing the research on architecting microservices and we rigorously apply it to the 71 selected studies. We synthesize the obtained data and produce a clear overview of the state of the art. This gives a solid basis to plan for future research and applications of architecting microservices.},

Compared to IEC 61131-3 standard used in traditional industrial production, IEC 61499 standard can bring more advantages to meet the realization of Smart Factory, such as flexibility, distribution and event-driven execution. In this paper, we propose a new Virtual Commissioning (VC) architecture for IEC 61499-based control applications. We build an online collaborative VC platform with the help of cloud computing and containerization technologies. Furthermore, we discuss and propose the utilization of soft-PLC containers from different vendors to meet users' commissioning requirements for different hardware configurations.

However, the implementation the trending Cyber Physical Systems concepts via 'Plug-and-Produce' devices produces some communication overheads. In this direction, the openMOS project aims to decouple the elements that are responsible for adaptation and general operations of the system. This allows the system to have two parallel processes. Towards this end, the priority is to deliver high performance process executions, while the other process focuses on delivering the required agility. The focus of this work is narrowed down to the development of task execution tables that guarantees high performance process executions. In this direction, the definition of task execution table is based on an existing AutomationML (AML) model that highlights the explicit relationships between the Product, Process and Resource (PPR) domains. A new decisional attribute has been added to the existing 'Skill' concept, which provides the flexibility to incorporate eventbased process alternatives. An insight description on how the system handles process executions during run-time failures is also provided. Finally, this paper illustrates the run-time implementation of the execution table with a help of an industrial case study that has been used for a demonstration activity within the openMOS project.},

Trends like shortening life cycles of products, increasing numbers of product variants and the resulting decrease in lot sizes put pressure on companies' operations.

Research contributions that focus on a higher level description of machine functionalities are seen as a promising approach to cope with the aforementioned challenges. While there exists quite a large amount of contributions on this topic, these contributions focus either on formal models or on executable functions. The developed models mostly represent project specific contents and are rarely based on industry standards.In this contribution, we present an approach to a formal model of machine capabilities that directly includes a description of executable skills. The presented capability and skill model is based on a variety of separate so-called ontology design patterns that contain the vocabulary of industry standards and therefore provide a profound knowledge which is agreed upon by a large community. In addition to the description of our model, this contribution shows how these models can be used in order to achieve simple and rapid integration of new manufacturing modules and their capabilities.},

We introduce the vendor-neutral OpenPnP reference architecture, which can largely automate the configuration and integration tasks for commissioning. Using an example implementation, we demonstrate that OpenPnP can reduce the configuration and integration effort up to 90 percent and scales up to tens of thousands of communicated signals per second for large Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) systems. OpenPnP can serve as a template for practitioners implementing IIoT applications throughout the automation industry and streamline commissioning processes in many thousands of control system installations.},

However, the implementation the trending Cyber Physical Systems concepts via 'Plug-and-Produce' devices produces some communication overheads. In this direction, the openMOS project aims to decouple the elements that are responsible for adaptation and general operations of the system. This allows the system to have two parallel processes. Towards this end, the priority is to deliver high performance process executions, while the other process focuses on delivering the required agility. The focus of this work is narrowed down to the development of task execution tables that guarantees high performance process executions. In this direction, the definition of task execution table is based on an existing AutomationML (AML) model that highlights the explicit relationships between the Product, Process and Resource (PPR) domains. A new decisional attribute has been added to the existing 'Skill' concept, which provides the flexibility to incorporate eventbased process alternatives. An insight description on how the system handles process executions during run-time failures is also provided. Finally, this paper illustrates the run-time implementation of the execution table with a help of an industrial case study that has been used for a demonstration activity within the openMOS project.},

   abstract = {The ongoing manufacturing systems transformation from mass production towards mass customization requires more flexible engineering solutions than the existing ones. The recently proposed control architectures target, among other plug-and-produce features, a reduction of configuration times. This is relevant for building a new production line as well as for faster reconfiguration when adding new hardware and product variants to an existing manufacturing line. This paper identifies operational requirements for such reconfiguration scenarios and proposes a way to implement them using the concept of a device adapter. The device adapter contains a device description and constantly updates it following the reconfiguration changes happening in a manufacturing system. This allows not only to detect the changes in the hardware, which appear in the production system, using the device discovery mechanisms but also automatically adapt the software. Preliminary tests have been performed on a demonstrator that shows both virtual and physical executions combined in a single system. The proposed solution supports automatic hardware and software reconfiguration on-the-fly without a need to stop and restart the whole production system.},

   abstract = {This paper describes a method together with an implementation for automating the detection, identification and configuration of newly added resources and parts in a Plug and Produce system using OPC UA. In a Plug and Produce system, resources and parts are usually controlled by agents, forming a multi-agent system of collaborating resources. Hence, when a resource or part is connected to the system, a corresponding agent must be instantiated and associated with that specific device. In order to automate this, the system needs information about newly connected devices. This information could, for example, be positional data describing where the device is connected. Some devices like tools and parts to be processed have no own network connection, but still, they should get an agent with correct configuration instantiated. In this work, OPC UA is used for communication between devices and the corresponding agents. All agents and their communication are handled by an Agent Handling System, consisting of an OPC UA HUB together with functions for device detection and agent instantiation. The HUB is used for transferring data between devices and their agents in the network by OPC UA protocols. When a device is connected to the network, it is detected, and a connection is automatically created to the HUB that becomes configured for transmitting data between the device and its corresponding agent.},

Due to the increasing networking of machines and the virtualization of data and functionalities, flexible production systems, so-called cyber-physical production systems, are emerging. The resulting virtual representation of the systems increases the transparency of processes and makes it possible to integrate further analyses and optimizations, thus releasing additional technical and economic potential. During last years several concepts have been developing in order to increase the productivity of production machines and their built-in components. An important use-case to increase the availability of machines is the automated integration of components into a system, so called Plug-and-Produce.In this paper an approach to automate the commissioning of a fluid power machine based on the concepts of Industry 4.0 Systems is presented. After introducing the use-case scenario of the electro-hydraulic actuator, key elements for the automated integration process, the virtual representation and the plug-and-produce module are presented. The virtual representation of a component provides important information and services to support the automated commissioning. The plug-and-produce module collects and processes the information of all individual components to derive a valid commissioning procedure for the whole system. Finally, a draft of the entire plug-and-produce process of an electro hydraulic actuator is presented, providing a general understanding of cyber-physical fluid power systems.},

   abstract = {Typical industrial workcells are composed of a plenitude of devices from various manufacturers, which rely on their own specific control interfaces. To reduce setup and reconfiguration times, a hardware-agnostic Plug & Produce system is required. In this paper, we present a system architecture that uses generic and semantically augmented OPC UA skills for robots, tools, and other system components. Standardized skill interfaces and parameters facilitate flexible component interchange and automatic parametrization with a focus on reusability of skills across different platforms and domains. The hierarchical composition of such skills allows for additional abstraction through the grouping of functionalities. Through the extension of OPC UA discovery services, available skills are dynamically detected whenever a manufacturing system's component is updated. The introduced Plug & Produce system is evaluated in multiple industrial workcells composed of robots, tool changer, electric parallel gripper, and vacuum gripper - all controlled via the proposed OPC UA skill interface. The evaluation of our system architecture demonstrates the applicability of the Plug & Produce concept in the domain of robot-based industrial assembly. Although it is necessary to adapt existing hardware to comply with the semantic skill concept, the initial one-time effort yields reoccurring efficiency gains during system reconfiguration. In particular, small lot production benefits from reduced changeover times.},

This is solved by defining skills on resources, and goals for parts. To reach these goals, process plans are defined with a sequence of skills to be utilized without specifying specific resources. This makes it possible to separate the physical world from the process plans. When a process plan requires a skill, e.g., grip with a gripper resource, then that skill may require further skills, e.g., move with a robot resource. This creates a tree of connected resources that are not defined in the process plan. Physical and logical compatibility between resources in this tree is checked by comparing several parameters defined on the resources and the part. This article presents an algorithm together with a multiagent system framework that handles the search and matching required for selecting the correct resources.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, shorter and more flexible production cycles are vital to meet the increasing customised product demand. As any delays and downtimes in the production towards time-to-market means a substantial financial loss, manufacturers take an interest in getting the production system to full utilisation as quickly as possible. The concept of plug-and-produce manufacturing systems facilitates an easy integration process through embedded intelligence in the devices. However, a human still needs to validate the functionality of the system and more importantly must ensure that the required quality and performance is delivered. This is done during the ramp-up phase, where the system is assembled and tested first-time. System adaptations and a lack of standard procedures make the ramp-up process still largely dependent on the operator's experience level. A major problem that currently occurs during ramp-up, is a loss of knowledge and information due to a lack of means to capture the human's experience. Acquiring this information can be used to simplify future ramp-up cases as additional insights about change actions and their effect on the system could be revealed. Hence, this paper proposes a decision-support framework for plug-and-produce assembly systems that will help to reduce the ramp-up effort and ultimately shorten ramp-up time. As an illustrative example, a glueing station developed as part of the European project openMOS is considered.},

Hence, we implement "CPU-based" and "CPU-Memory-based" load balancing techniques and evaluate their performance compared to the static Round-robin and random-based load balancing techniques using Ryu OpenFlow controller. The results show that the proposed schemes achieve more reliability and higher resource utilization than the Round-robin and random-based load balancing strategies. In addition, they have a lower response time and higher transaction rate and throughput. The proposed schemes exhibit more scalability and low-cost characteristics.},

   abstract = {Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is characterized by the integration of digital technologies into manufacturing processes and highlights new requirements for industrial systems such as greater interoperability, decentralization, modularization, and independence. The traditional hierarchical architecture of Industrial Automation Systems (IAS) does not fulfill these requirements and is evolving to incorporate information technologies in order to support I4.0 applications. The integration among these technologies, equipment, and systems at different industry levels requires a migration from the legacy vertical architecture to a flat architecture based on services. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) and, more recently, microservices play a critical role in I4.0 by providing a framework for integrating complex systems and meeting those requirements. This paper presents the development of a Microservice-Oriented Architecture for Industry 4.0 (MOAI), initially focused on evolving IAS to the I4.0. The objective is to describe the development, deployment, and testing of an IAS architecture based on microservices prepared for I4.0 applications. On the contrary to developing the whole software for the industrial SOA, the MOAI was developed on top of the Moleculer framework, which allowed focusing on creating services and applications for the automation and process control industry context. The development of several microservices and security mechanisms for the MOAI is presented, as is the deployment of IAS applications as services such as process control, SCADA, discrete automation, among others. The MOAI was implemented in a process control pilot plant for experimentation. Experimental results of the MOAI for IAS applications are investigated, the microservice communication performance is evaluated, and the pros and cons of microservices for I4.0 are discussed.},

   abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution or industry 4.0 has become a trend topic nowadays, this standard-based strategy integrates Smart Factories, Cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, and Internet of Service with the aim of extended the capacities of the manufacturing systems. Although several authors have presented the advantages of this approach, few papers refer to an architecture that allows the correct implementation of industry 4.0 applications using the guidelines of the reference architecture model (RAMI 4.0). In this way, this article exposes the essential characteristics that allow a manufacturing system to be retrofitting as a correct industry 4.0 application. Specifically, an intelligent manufacturing system under a holonic approach was developed and implemented using standards like FDI, AutomationML and OPC UA according to the RAMI 4.0},

   abstract = {Manufacturing is continuously evolving from concept development to methods and tools available for the production of goods for use or sale. Traditionally, manufacturing refers to an industrial production process through which raw materials are transformed into finished products to be sold in the market. However, these days manufacturing is considered to be an integrated concept at all levels from machines to production systems to an entire business level operation. Although there have been considerable developments in manufacturing technologies and processes, the actual scope and elements of manufacturing systems are complex and not adequately defined. This paper provides a review of both the tangible and intangible elements of manufacturing systems and presents a state-of-the-art survey of published work. It studies the evolution of research in manufacturing starting from past and current trends to future developments. How manufacturing systems have been classified is also presented. Through this extensive survey of the literature, future directions of this changing field are suggested.},

   abstract = {One of the key ideas of Industry 4.0 is the availability of a digital representation of each industrial asset within an Industry 4.0 network, the 'Asset Administration Shell' (AAS). The AAS combines data related to an asset and software interfaces which provide access and explorability of the asset data in the network. Because an accepted standard is missing, component manufacturers are currently not able to economically release basic asset models for their products. This creates a deadlock situation for the widespread introduction of Industry 4.0 driven smart factory concepts. This paper describes and compares the most promising approaches to model the asset administration shell: the AAS model of the Platform I4.0, and the AutomationML component description of the AutomationML e.V. The technical concepts are comparatively analyzed for strengths and weaknesses and a useful combination of both model worlds is proposed.},

   abstract = {The technical innovation of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0—I4.0) is based on the following respective conditions: horizontal and vertical integration of manufacturing systems, decentralization of computing resources and continuous digital engineering throughout the product life cycle. The reference architecture model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) is a common model for systematizing, structuring and mapping the complex relationships and functionalities required in I4.0 applications. Despite its adoption in I4.0 projects, RAMI 4.0 is an abstract model, not an implementation guide, which hinders its current adoption and full deployment. As a result, many papers have recently studied the interactions required among the elements distributed along the three axes of RAMI 4.0 to develop a solution compatible with the model. This paper investigates RAMI 4.0 and describes our proposal for the development of an open-source control device for I4.0 applications. The control device is one of the elements in the hierarchy-level axis of RAMI 4.0. Its main contribution is the integration of open-source solutions of hardware, software, communication and programming, covering the relationships among three layers of RAMI 4.0 (assets, integration and communication). The implementation of a proof of concept of the control device is discussed. Experiments in an I4.0 scenario were used to validate the operation of the control device and demonstrated its effectiveness and robustness without interruption, failure or communication problems during the experiments.},

   abstract = {In the two decades following its initial release, SQLite has become the most widely deployed database engine in existence. Today, SQLite is found in nearly every smartphone, computer, web browser, television, and automobile. Several factors are likely responsible for its ubiquity, including its in-process design, standalone codebase, extensive test suite, and cross-platform file format. While it supports complex analytical queries, SQLite is primarily designed for fast online transaction processing (OLTP), employing row-oriented execution and a B-tree storage format. However, fueled by the rise of edge computing and data science, there is a growing need for efficient in-process online analytical processing (OLAP). DuckDB, a database engine nicknamed "the SQLite for analytics", has recently emerged to meet this demand. While DuckDB has shown strong performance on OLAP benchmarks, it is unclear how SQLite compares. Furthermore, we are aware of no work that attempts to identify root causes for SQLite's performance behavior on OLAP workloads. In this paper, we discuss SQLite in the context of this changing workload landscape. We describe how SQLite evolved from its humble beginnings to the full-featured database engine it is today. We evaluate the performance of modern SQLite on three benchmarks, each representing a different flavor of in-process data management, including transactional, analytical, and blob processing. We delve into analytical data processing on SQLite, identifying key bottlenecks and weighing potential solutions. As a result of our optimizations, SQLite is now up to 4.2X faster on SSB. Finally, we discuss the future of SQLite, envisioning how it will evolve to meet new demands and challenges.},
